									<h3>Committee Strength :- 100 (Double Delegations allowed)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The Disarmament and International Security Committee (1st Committee of the UN General Assembly) deals with disarmament, global challenges and threats to peace that affect the international community and seeks out solutions to the challenges in the international security regime.
								</p>
								<p>
									Devoted to “the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security,” the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) of the United Nations (UN) focuses on the topics of arms control, pacifistic conflict resolution, and global safety. As a General Assembly (GA) Mains Committee, DISEC is inclusive of all UN Member States, serving as a large forum for discussion on all topics regarding international security. Each member has one vote.
								</p>
								<p>Though the Security Council (UNSC) is the only UN body capable of imposing force upon Member States (economically, militarily, or otherwise), the First Committee makes valuable recommendations to the Security Council on all aspects of matters that place global peace at risk. Because the First Committee’s legislative process incorporates the voice of every Member States to the UN, its resolutions are always respected and considered by the Security Council. These resolutions are also salient due to their normative nature.</p>

									<h3>FIRST AGENDA</h3><br>
									<h3> Role of diamonds in fuelling conflict</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									In the 1990s, as armed groups became reliant on revenues from natural resources, illicit, un- cut diamonds emerged as a prime instigator of conflict. For instance, the arms race between communities in Sierra Leone and Angola, which was financed primarily by the illicit sale of these ‘blood diamonds’, devastated the two countries.
								</p>
								<p>In response, the “Kimberley Process Certification Scheme” was drafted, which set a ban on this heinous trade. The international community strived to save the lives of those children in Africa whose future would be spoiled by further conflicts involving diamonds. Today, this trade has dwindled to only 1% of the total diamond trade, but even one conflict diamond is too many!</p>
							<p>So delegates, speak freely on your countries’ policy to halt this trade, and the efforts being undertaken towards building a peaceful, conflict-free world shining as bright as a diamond.</p>

									<h3>SECOND AGENDA</h3><br>
									<h3> Global Nuclear Disarmament</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The end of the second world war led to something which might be far more devastating than the war itself, the race for nuclear arms. This race for powerful atomic arms has reached a point where another instance of war would lead to a nuclear holocaust.
								</p>
								<p>
									The current situation definitely calls for immediate action, action to be taken to disarm nuclear warheads, so as to prevent the extinction of the human race. It is of utmost importance for countries possessing these weapons to not only agree for a policy of disarmament, but to work together and prevent radicals from acquiring these weapons.
								</p>
								<p>At the IITBBSR MUN 2017, it is expected that these issues will be discussed and resolutions be adopted to hopefully provide a nuclear weapon free future.</p>
